# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
To analyze the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to recieve reviews for their products. Out of the 50 datasets available I used the video games dataset for this analysis.

**51% of the paid vine reviews were 5 stars**. And only **39%** of the unpaid reviews were 5 stars.



## Summary


In conclusion, you can see that the reviews from the paid vine program had higher percentage of being a 5 star review and you could say there is bias there due to the fact those people are getting paid to do the review. There isn't quite enough data to support that opinion just yet. From this dataset 51% were 5 star reviews from the vine program and 39% were 5 star reviews from the unpaid reviews. The population sample from the vine program is too small compared to the unpaid reviews. As you can see that only 94 reviews were considered helpful in the vine program and 40,471 from the unpaid reviews. You can see the difference of the population samples. In order to better test this idea is to collect more of the reviews by doing the same analysis to the other 50 available datasets and see if the results still show the same bias.
